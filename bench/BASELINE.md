# O0 baseline — SceneIO I/O harness

Snapshot from `python bench/bench_io.py --runs 7`. **Indicative** (median of 7,
single machine, local **MSVC** build, warm cache); the *conclusions* below are what
order the O1+ sweep, not the exact MB/s. Regenerate on any machine — the harness is
the source of truth, this file is a dated reading.

Columns: `payloadMB` raw array size · `fileMB` encoded size · `sioW/sioR` sceneio
write/read MB/s over the payload · `oraW/oraR` the oracle lib (0 = no oracle) ·
`rPeakMB` peak Python alloc on `read_bytes()->decode` · `sio/ora` read-throughput ratio.

Oracles: Pillow (png/jpeg/webp), laspy (las), numpy (npy). hdr/exr/netpbm/xyz/
gaussian/spz/splat have no in-process oracle wired yet.

## Conclusions (these order the sweep)

1. **O1 (mmap) is a universal, confirmed win.** `rPeakMB == fileMB` for *every*
   codec — the read path allocates a whole-file `bytes` copy equal to the file
   size, exactly what mmap removes. Largest absolute savings: **xyz 56 MB, las 26,
   exr 12.5, gaussian_ply 11, npy 8.4** per read. O1 applies uniformly and the
   memory reduction is deterministic, not speculative. Do O1 first.

2. **Encode throughput has three real hotspots** (decode is healthy everywhere —
   competitive with or faster than the oracles: npy 1.4×, webp 1.5×, las 0.73×):
   - **jpeg 60 vs libjpeg 900 MB/s (0.28×)** — stb's JPEG *encoder* is the outlier.
     SIMD/threads (O4) won't fix an algorithmic gap; flag as "accept, or swap to a
     faster permissive encoder later" rather than an O4 target.
   - **xyz write 21 MB/s** — text float→string formatting bound, and 4.7× file
     bloat (56 MB for a 12 MB payload). O4 candidate (faster float formatter) —
     but text is inherently the slow/fat path.
   - **webp lossless write 14 MB/s** — libwebp lossless effort; O4 can lower the
     effort level or enable its worker threads.

3. **Read peak is dominated by the bytes copy, not decode** — confirming the
   optimization order: O1 (kill the copy) before O4 (speed the decode), because the
   copy is the bigger, universal cost.

## Harness coverage added with O1

The harness now builds non-empty `Reconstruction` and `PosedViewSet` inputs and
covers all 23 codecs, including both COLMAP directory variants, Bundler, NVM,
OpenMVG, transforms.json, TUM, KITTI, and NPZ. ImageIO/OpenEXR-backed oracle
adapters are wired for Netpbm/HDR/EXR and degrade cleanly when the installed
ImageIO backend cannot handle Radiance HDR. `--scale` generates large fixtures,
`--cold-cache` requests `POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED` where supported, and the table
reports both `tracemalloc` and sampled RSS.

## O1 mmap delta — 2026-07-23

Local MSVC run after O1 (`bench_io.py --runs 3`). `bPeakMB` retains the legacy
`read_bytes()` measurement and `mPeakMB` measures the same decoder over a
read-only mmap. Throughput columns remain in-memory codec measurements and are
within baseline noise; the deterministic result is that the Python whole-file
allocation disappears for every single-file codec.

The exact traced mmap peaks were below the table's 0.05 MB display precision.
The committed 16 MiB `.npy` memory test also requires mmap peak allocation below
one eighth of file size while the bytes path must account for at least 90% of
the file size. A generated `--scale 2 --runs 1` sweep exercised a 113.0 MB XYZ
file and retained a 0.0 MB displayed mmap peak. RSS columns include decoded
output, allocator reuse, and mmap page residency, so the input-copy proof is the
traced-allocation delta plus exact exporter/core pointer identity; RSS remains a
whole-process diagnostic rather than an isolated-copy assertion.
