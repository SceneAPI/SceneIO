"""DataType id registry — the logical data objects of the typed pipeline.

The contract-plane home of the DataType vocabulary the SceneAPI family
agrees on. DataTypes are the nouns: the logical objects that flow
between operations, independent of serialization. One type has many
*formats* (the :mod:`sceneio.formats.registry` axis); keeping the
axes separate means composition is format-independent and a
cross-format coercion is a type-preserving execution detail, not a
pipeline edge.

``CORE_DATA_TYPES`` mirrors, byte-for-byte, the vocabulary in the
sceneapi core's ``sceneapi/server/core/datatypes.py`` (ids, kinds,
titles, descriptions); the core re-homes its module onto this one as
pure re-exports. Do NOT invent new ids here; wire identity is Phase-C
territory. ``FormatSpec.kind`` in the sibling registry names ids from
this vocabulary.
